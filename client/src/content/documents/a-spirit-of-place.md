“A Spirit of Place” is a speech delivered by Pepperdine chancellor [[William S. Banowsky]] at the dedication of the Malibu campus on May 23, 1970. The address is among the most highly regarded speeches in the history of Pepperdine; it was subsequently published as a pamphlet. The speech was delivered just weeks after student protests roiled university campuses across the country in response to the US invasion of Cambodia and the shootings at Kent State.

> ## "A SPIRIT OF PLACE"
> Today we dedicate this new campus in the midst of the saddest semester perhaps in the history of American higher education.
> 
> In recent days, the issues which rend and tear our nation have focused upon the college campus with terrible force. Six students have died in the violent clash of consciences; campus scenes of tear gas and bayonets are often featured on evening telecasts; scores of colleges have been closed. As polarization accelerates, voices on both sides of the confrontation warn that the worst is yet to come.
> 
> Why is our nation seeming to come apart at the seams? Whatever happened to the great American dream? When one surveys the years between 1900 and 1970, the despair arises over the vast difference between where now are and where we were supposed to have been by now. Our century started on such a high note of optimism. Men were saying that just given a little more time and education — and all the problems which plague mankind would be solved. On my shelves, for instance, is a book, published in 1907, which conclusively proves that war is a relic from man's barbaric past that will never again be necessary.
> 
> ### The Cult of Progress
> And the magic carpet which was to carry us to this utopia was education. More event than in the promises of religion, twentieth century man placed his confidence in the efficacy of education. And perhaps the high priest of this cult of progress was the brilliant philosopher, John Dewey.
> 
> But the glorious American dream seems now to have become a nightmare. Historians may one day express amazement that the optimistic credo of John Dewey was written in the same century with the pessimistic musings of existential philosophers such as Jean Paul Sartre or Albert Camus. Sartre's sad dictum is that, "There is no escape from the human dilemma." Today the boys who will die in Vietnam are the grandsons of men who marched off in 1917 to fight the war to end all wars.
> 
> When one considers how much confidence our society had placed in education, one understands why we are now disillusioned with the whole process. Education has not come through on its lofty promises. On one hand, the students complain of the bigness, the irrelevance, the impersonality of the education establishment; on the other hand, the older generation looks on in bewilderment, frequently attributing the problem to permissiveness and compromise by those in authority. But on one thing everybody is agreed: something is wrong in higher education.
> 
> ### Why Another College?
> There is, of course, nothing new about problems, and our generation would be naive to imagine that all of our challenges are novel. What causes our particular futility is the realization that after half a century of the most extensive program of mass education in all history, and after building more than 2,300 colleges and universities, we are yet agonizing over the same, ancient human problems.
> 
> Why, then, start another college? Why have we chosen to launch this ambitious new project at the very time when some would advise retrenchment?
> 
> It is because we do not plan to build just another college. The distinctive institution we envision will minister directly to the central human questions, hence to the basic challenge of our day.
> 
> Perhaps we have not chosen this time so much as the time has chosen us. For the contribution we seek to make can best be described in terms of the two basic convictions we hold about liberal arts education. First, that it must be value-centered; and secondly, that it must be person-centered.
> 
> ### The Value Vacuum
> Much of the business of education has been conducted in what might best be called a value vacuum. Understandably upset by the past excesses of religious sectarianism, academe has adopted a stance of detached neutrality. Eschewing value judgments as too subjective, professors have often envisioned their task as simply "sticking to the facts."
>
> The result has been a serious confusion in the area of values — the very area that matters most. This confusion has produced a loss of meaning that threatens every aspect of society, particularly by undermining zest among the young, where zest for life should be strongest. America's youth is wondering why doing this is any better than doing that, or why doing either one is better than doing nothing at all. Sadly, suicide is now the second highest cause of death among American college students.
> 
> Young people are asking what relevance the facts and dates have to the ultimate issues of life and death. Millions now militantly question the possibility, in the pursuit of knowledge, of any such detached neutrality. One lesson graphically to be learned from the campus turmoil is that education cannot be dispensed like so many goods across the counter.
> 
> ### A Rich Tradition
> We are determined to bring together on these hills a community of scholars who hold distinctive spiritual beliefs. Since its founding in 1937, Pepperdine College's deepest convictions have always centered upon spiritual realities. As we create this new campus at Malibu and expand the Pepperdine dream toward University status, we commit ourselves anew to value-centered education. While the waters about us churn with confusion, there has never been a time in which we have been more certain that the course of Christian education was the right course for Pepperdine College.
> 
> In taking this position we stand in a rich tradition, stretching back to the very earliest times in America. In 1638, over a century and a half before the founding of this nation, America's first college was established at Cambridge, Massachusetts. Significantly, it was a small, liberal arts, church-related institution. Following [[Harvard]], seven of the eight colleges founded in colonial times were Christian institutions of higher learning. For instance, Kings College, later to become [[Columbia|Columbia University]], placed an advertisement in the New York newspapers in 1754 stating: "The chief thing that is arrived at in this college is to teach young people to know God in Christ Jesus, and . . . to train them in virtuous habits . . . as may render them creditable to their families, ornaments to their country, and useful to the public weal in our generation."
> 
> But in time, many church-related colleges began to drift from these founding purposes. This erosion was one reason which motivated [[George Pepperdine|George]] and [[Helen Pepperdine]] to found a Christian college in central Los Angeles. Thirty-five years ago, on a day much like this one, Mr. Pepperdine said in his [[dedicatory address|founder's statement]]: "If we educate a man's mind but do not educate his heart, we make a dangerous man."
> 
> ### Advancing the Changeless
> Mr. Pepperdine was a lifelong member of the church of Christ, and we are especially grateful to our fraternal relationship with this religious group. Although we are completely independent and under no church board, these non-denominational congregations form our closest constituency. And unlike the pattern of most church-related colleges, in our era of growth and expansion we intend to strengthen, not loosen, these ties with our own brethren.
> 
> But as we unashamedly put Christian values at the heart of the whole educational process, we will resist any sectarian spirit. We will do nothing to stifle full and open academic inquiry nor shall we pose as an institution which knows all truth. What we affirm is that while our vision of truth is always limited, ultimate truth actually exists. We affirm that the universe is undergirded by an objective moral order. We will continue to keep pace with change; but our main purpose, in this place, will be to discover what is not changing. And our central conviction has been, is today, and will be that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.
> 
> ### The Person-Centered College
> Secondly, we will bring into life, at this place, a type of education which focuses personal attention upon each student as an individual. The central crisis in our time is a crisis in the quality of life for the individual. Man is steadily being dehumanized, and the process is nowhere more apparent than in our mechanized, impersonalized approach to education. Who doesn't sympathize a bit with the student carrying the protest poster: "I am a human being; please do not fold, spindle or mutilate."
> 
> It was Jesus' idea that one person is of greater worth than all the material world combined. In that spirit we shall enroll each student as a sacred trust. There is in our complex age clearly a place for the multiversity, with its research orientation, massive student body, and specialized faculty. But there has perhaps never been a greater need for the small, person-centered college.
> 
> Throughout American history, such colleges have produced more than their proportionate share of outstanding leaders in science, politics, business and religion. Surely there is something powerful about an academic atmosphere in which a professor knows the students personally and is personally known by the students; in which he is available to the students, not only as a lecturer, but as a person.
> 
> I am frequently asked how colleges like Pepperdine avoid some of the problems now confronting higher education. The secret lies in the faculty, who know and are with the students daily, and who, by giving a high degree of personal attention, let off the pressures before they build to a breaking point. The exciting thing to happen in this place, then, will be the thing which happens to the students. We are by no means fed up with today's students. In fact, we are building this new college in large measure because of our faith in young people.
> 
> Our commitment to *values* and *persons* is more than a creedal statement. We know that we will eventually be judged in terms of practice. Thus even in matters such as the design of our buildings and the details of our curriculum, this philosophy has been central. Our curriculum, built along interdisciplinary lines, has been carefully conceived with the unity of knowledge presupposed. The faculty offices will be constructed in such a way that warm, interpersonal counseling can occur. Most importantly, our selection of personnel, both in the past and in the future, will fulfil our commitment to value-centered and person-centered education.
> 
> ### The Soul of the College
> And so, what we hope to build is much more than a beautiful campus. it will, as you can sense, be that. But if that is all we shall have accomplished, we shall have failed. What we hope to create here, in these hills, is *a spirit of place*. A place where minds will be opened, where lives will be changed, where lasting relationships will be formed. A college is, after all, something like a human being in that both must have a soul of some kind. My deepest concern, in this hour of dedication, is for the soul of the college.
> 
> I would like, in the final analysis, for our work to be judged on the basis of what we have believed, and on how we have put that faith into action.
> 
> It is in this spirit that we hallow this ground and accept this challenge. These historic acres along the rim of the Malibu will, from this day, never again be the same. From this day forward let it be known that, in this place, “We look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are unseen; for the things that are seen are temporal, but the things that are unseen are eternal.”
