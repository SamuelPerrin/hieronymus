This is a public statement about the [[Smoot affair]] by Pepperdine president [[M. Norvel Young]] released to the press. In the statement, Young explains that the college refuses to grant an honorary doctorate to [[Dan Smoot]] because it was a condition of a posthumous gift from the estate of [[Dallas B. Lewis|D. B. Lewis]]. The statement is undated but was probably issued on May 5, 1966.

>
>”We reaffirm our commitment to the search for truth in an atmosphere of academic freedom and responsibility.
