>Dear Mr. Younger:
>
>The reason for writing this letter is because of a telephone call I received last evening from [[M. Norvel Young]], Chancellor of Pepperdine University.
>
>A year ago I was contacted by [[Gordon Del Faro]], [[Trent Devenney]], and [[Doyle Swain]] to represent the two and one-half million members of the Churches of Christ in problems they insisted had occurred and were now occurring at Pepperdine University. It was their judgment there were financial irregularities, unethical practices, unorthodox administration policies, and just as important, a departure from conservative Christian ideals that this institution was founded upon. I accepted this responsibility and explained to them clearly I was not interested in being a part of a witch-hunt, but I was interested in lending my influence to help Pepperdine achieve its goals in becoming a truly Christian University.
>
>In several meetings I have had with some of the executives of Pepperdine University I outlined in detail to them some problem areas that I thought needed attention. I am happy to report to you, they listened very carefully and did make some changes in some areas. For example:
>1. Perhaps the weakest department at Pepperdine which should be their strongest at the present time, is their accounting department. I recommended to Dr. Young to retain the services of Stephenson Financial Service, Glendale, California, to help guide them in their now rapid expansion programs. I made the same suggestion to Mr. Stephenson, the President of this accounting firm. Today, as I understand it, Stephenson Financial Service, has been retained and is now working with Pepperdine University.
>2. I spoke out very sharply about classes and subjects that have been taught in recent months at Pepperdine University. Two classes that were very objectionable and offensive to many members of the Churches of Christ across the United States were: “World of the Supernatural” and “Alternate Styles of Marriage.” Dr. Young has informed me these courses will not be offered the second time.
>3. I recommended to Dr. Young some changes and additions that should be made, in my judgment, in the make-up and membership of the Board of Trustees of Pepperdine University. I have reasons to believe he will accept some of these recommendations.
>4. The same recommendations were made in reference to the faculty. I also believe he will accept some of these suggestions.
>
>Many other suggestions and recommendations were made to Dr. Young of greater and lesser importance. I firmly believe the Administration at Pepperdine University will act constructively on each one of these suggestions.
>
>Now, back to the telephone call I received last night from Dr. Young. He asked me if I would help Pepperdine University and lend my influence on behalf of Pepperdine University. For your information, I would be glad to do anything and everything I can to help Dr. Young and Pepperdine University. However, I do know your office is in the process of conducting an [[Attorney General investigation|investigation]] of internal affairs at Pepperdine University. Would you please answer the following questions?
>5. Would I be premature in beginning an active and positive program on behalf of Pepperdine University, not only in raising necessary funds, but the recruitment of qualified students, particularly students from families who have their membership in the Churches of Christ.
>6. Would it perhaps be better for me to wait until your investigation is completed and your report made before beginning my efforts on behalf of Pepperdine University.
>
>Your answers to these questions are important to me. I am sure they are important to Dr. Norvel Young, [[William S. Banowsky|Dr. William Banowsky]], and Pepperdine University.
>
>I will work for you again in your campaign for re-election to the office of Attorney General. You will be re-elected.
>
>You made a mistake in not running for the office of Governor in the State of California. you just happen to be the best qualified man for this job in both Republican and Democratic parties. You would have been elected.
>
>Yours truly,
>\[unsigned\]
