Sir,

I had the honor of receiving your letter of the 2d instant, and duly observed its contents. I am persuaded your Excellency is aware of the extent of our current predicament concerning supplies, and I have taken the liberty to detail my observations on this matter for your consideration.

The situation at [[New Windsor]] has been precarious since the late frost, and reports from General Greene confirm similar conditions to the south. Were the Continental Congress to address these concerns with greater haste, we might avoid the diminishing morale among the ranks.

Recent communications from [[Philadelphia]] suggest that supplementary provisions may be forthcoming, but I remain doubtful of their adequacy or timely arrival. The commissary's accounts show dwindling stores that cannot sustain the men through the coming month if circumstances remain unchanged.

I have dispatched riders to the neighboring counties with appeals for aid, though with winter's damage to local farms, their capacity to assist is limited. Several merchants have promised shipments at reduced rates, recognizing our cause, but transport remains a challenge with the condition of the roads.

Regarding your inquiry about preparations for the summer campaign, I have prepared detailed plans but hesitate to commit them fully until the supply situation clarifies. The proposed operation toward Yorktown requires provisions we cannot currently guarantee.

> I submit that we may need to reconsider our strategy should these conditions persist, though I remain hopeful that your influence with Congress might yield more favorable arrangements.

The officers under my command continue to demonstrate remarkable patience and ingenuity in managing these shortages, a testament to their character and dedication to our cause. Nevertheless, I fear testing their endurance much further.

Should you require more specific accounts of our situation, I would be pleased to provide them at your convenience.

I remain, with the greatest respect and attachment,

Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

[[Alexander Hamilton|A. Hamilton]]
