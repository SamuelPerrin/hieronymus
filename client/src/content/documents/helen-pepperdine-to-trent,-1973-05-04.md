This is a letter from [[Helen Pepperdine]], the wife of founder [[George Pepperdine]], to Pepperdine alumnus [[Trent Devenney]], regarding [[Trent Devenney affair|his allegations]].

>May 4, 1973
>
>Dear [[Trent Devenney|Trent]]:
>
>I appreciate the opportunity to have met with you on several occasions during recent weeks and to have discussed with you by telephone a number of times matters which apparently concern you regarding Pepperdine University. I have carefully considered all of your allegations and have carefully read the documents which you have left with me. I want to report to you that I have personally made my own intensive inquiry into these matters and was in attendance at a meeting of the [[Board of Trustees]] on April 26 in which all details and implications of your allegations were thoroughly discussed.
>
>I think  it is only fair to you for me to state that I find your allegations to be irresponsible and without sufficient basis in fact. Furthermore, I have serious reason to believe that you have flagrantly misquoted me to others and have misrepresented my feelings.
>
>After considering all of you allegations, I wish to report that, in relation to this matter, the Trustees of Pepperdine University are united and in support of the Administration in its conduct of the University. The Executive Committee is fully aware of all of our financial transactions and obligations and are confident that the Administration is working with high standards of ethical conduct to achieve the goals of the University.
>
>Inasmuch as we have been in touch I felt that I should personally respond to you; but your conduct over the past few months has become a matter of official University concern. Therefore, you may expect a formal response from that quarter.
>
>Very truly yours,
>\[signed\] [[Helen Pepperdine|Helen L. Pepperdine]]
>(Mrs.) George Pepperdine
