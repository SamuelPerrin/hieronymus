This is a petition signed by twenty members of the Pepperdine faculty, including professor of history [[Arlie Hoover]], whose name is first on the list. The petition urges the college not to accept the conditional bequest of [[Dallas B. Lewis]] in the [[Smoot affair]]. The document is not dated, but it is probably from about May 4, 1966. The petition is typewritten, with handwritten corrections in blue ink and handwritten signatures in a variety of hands and colors.

>We regret the identification of Pepperdine College with extremist organizations such as the [[John Birch Society]] \[handwritten:\] *or any other group.* We believe that no gift should be accepted contingent upon the award of an honorary degree. We reaffirm our basic commitment to academic freedom and a Christian search for truth free of any political identification. It is our hope that the [[Young administration|administration]] of Pepperdine College will promptly refuse the restricted bequest of the late [[Dallas B. Lewis|Dallas Bedford Lewis]] and clarify the collegeâ€™s relation to any political group.
