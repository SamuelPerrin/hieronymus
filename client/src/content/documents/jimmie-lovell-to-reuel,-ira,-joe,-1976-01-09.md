This is a letter from Pepperdine trustee [[Jimmie Lovell|James L. “Jimmie” Lovell]] to his fellow trustees [[Reuel Lemmons]], [[Ira North]], and [[Joe Barnett]]. In the letter, Lovell urges his colleagues to support a [[the opening of the board|change to the bylaws]] of Pepperdine University that would allow for the first time non-members of the Churches of Christ to serve on the university’s governing board.

The letter was typed (inexpertly) by Lovell himself.

>After you men phoned me from Lubbock, I am sure you called [[William S. Banowsky|Bill]] – he contacted me later. I noted your deep concern in your conversation, and I am not void of it myself, but I see the question from more of where I am (geographically) than from where you are. Let me see if I can draw a picture, however, I suspect that you may today with Bill – maybe [[M. Norvel Young|Norvel]] too.
>
>So far as Pepperdine is as of now it is far more church related than ever before, and far more than [[George Pepperdine|Brother Pepperdine]] ever had in mind for it to be. With his [[Daniel Sommer|Sommer]] background he came a long way in what he did – thanks mostly to [[Hugh M. Tiner|Hugh Tiner]] – but he was vitally opposed to any courtship of the church – even to a preacher on the board. Had he lived and supplied all the money to operate the school as he had purposed, some of the Jews who broke him might have had more control today than we Christians.
>
>Take it from there to here, other than [[Associated Women for Pepperdine|AWP]] we have held fairly well to the same course, not because we did not wish closer relations – they just never materialized. There was the period from the beginning to the coming of Norv and [[J. P. Sanders|J. P.]] when we rode along with not even the moral support of churches as we enjoy today. I got the board to let me set up a deal with preachers and church leaders as Norvel did later. I was appointed chairman, but since we were drifting into a liberal stage (even in bigness today we do not face such a serious situation,) God, not we, worked it out. Actually, had Hugh not made [[1957 Pepperdine College Crisis|a mistake]] (we had long since forgotten [[Batsell Baxter|Brother Baxter]]’s) we would have had to lock her up.
>
>In any case, Norvel and J. P. saw us into a new day. I was again asked by the board – my only use to it over the years – to put the preachers together again, which I did, but [[Donald V. Miller|Don]] and Norvel took it over without comment and I found new fields of service, but not without some hurt. You men came on the board and [[Ira North|Ira]] and [[Reuel Lemmons|Reuel]] into Norvel’s [[Chancellor's Council|church group]], all of which was the most advanced step we had ever made (outside AWP) in church relations.
>
>We have a fine [[Religion and philosophy division|Bible Department]], and always have had, but I question if any one of us or any other loyal Christian would send his son or daughter to Pepperdine on strictly a “Church of Christ” basis as is the case with some of our other schools. We are not now, never have been, and I feel sure will never be a Christian institution as we have in most of our other schools. I have never associated myself myself \[*sic*\] with Pepperdine solely in that kind of framework – rather as a college, as Brother Pepperdine founded, where a youngster could get a good education in a spiritual atmosphere – with a lot of other Christian benefits.
>
>I see myself as a trustee – somewhat more – as I would if I were tied up in Rotary, some municipal assignment or political office. Surely any one of us can make a greater contribution through Pepperdine, along with what we may figure – and truthfully so – some weak spots, than in areas I just mentioned in which most of us, in one way or another, are involved. It reminds me of the old rich man who married a beautiful young woman. Finally his life-long friends in the Club felt that they should tell him that his wife was running out on him with a number of the boys. “I expected such when I married her but I had rather have a ten percent interest in something good than one hundred percent in something nobody wanted.”
>
>Ira possibly has more to lose sticking with Pepperdine than others of us – then [[Joe Barnett|Joe]] – I’m thinking in respect to our brotherhood in general. Reuel appears to operate somewhat on my basis – do as much good as we can while it lasts, along the line that even though the church in Jerusalem eventually died, there will be many in heaven due to it once having lived.
>
>Had it not been for my love for Norvel and Bill personally, I would long since have resigned – education is not my field. I know my way with men as Col. Rockwell with whom I once served on two boards. I would never have been on Pepperdine board in the first place had it not been for [[Earl V. Pullias|Brother Pullias]] who pretty much maneuvered me in as his backer, and I was as long as I felt the Lord was pleased. However, as long as either Norv or [[William S. Banowsky|Billy]] are there and right and righteousness the major portion, I am going to stick with them, and feel very strongly that you brethren should do so.
>
>Pepperdine is making in its own way as great a contribution to the Lord in this hellish area as any of our schools is doing. We have never conformed to our traditional code of Christian education, and the prposed \[*sic*\] steps before us at this time are further proof of it. However, it does not mean we are going to drown because our feet are under water. As shocking as it may be to some – somewhat to us all – a 60/40 basis is still quite a premium and sound percent for all we have to show and the tremendous possibilities of the future. We have at least another 50 years to speak for Christ through Pepperdine – what person living or dead could ask for more out of what those of the church may have put in it?
>
>All of which reminds me that I have over here on a table some 20,000 or more persons out of Christ asking Christians here in America to tell them what they must do to be saved – personal letters. You three men are leaders in three great churches. I beg each of you in the name of Christ in behalf of these unsaved souls to allow me to send you 100 or more of them with the necessary [[World Bible School|teaching materials]]. It will all be sent free and remain free unless, in time, the church may wish to help us cover our costs. I shall not forget that I have presented this matter to you.

>God bless each of you, your homes and much love. Use me while I live.
