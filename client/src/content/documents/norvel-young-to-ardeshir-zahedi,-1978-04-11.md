This is a letter from Pepperdine chancellor [[M. Norvel Young]] to Iranian ambassador [[Ardeshir Zahedi]], concerning the establishment of an endowed chair in honor of [[Farah Pahlavi]]. In the letter, Young explains that the university has created the position but that promised endowment had not yet been received, which formed the crux of the [[Shah debacle]].

>April 11, 1978

>Ambassador [[Ardeshir Zahedi]]
>Imperial Embassy of Iran
>2005 Massachusetts Avenue, N W
>Washington D. C. 20008

>Dear Ambassador Zahedi:
>
>Dr. Kazemian has conveyed your request for a copy of our proposal to [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|His Majesty the Shahanshah]] and an account of the presentation and the response.
>
>[[William S. Banowsky|President Banowsky]] and I presented the proposal (copy enclosed) to His Majesty and discussed the matter with him and the Minister of Protocol Dr. [[Hormoz Gharib]]. His Majesty was very gracious and stated that it pleased him that we wished to establish such a Chair in honor of the [[Farah Pahlavi|Empress]]. We talked about Malibu and the memory of this beautiful place and we showed him pictures of our campus. We understood that he approved the $1,000,000 grant at that time and Dr. Gharib confirmed the good news which was also picked up by the media and widely reported. Neither President Banowsky nor I talked to the media but we did see the report on all the channels and in the press (some copies enclosed.) Later this news was reported widely internationally and we received congratulations from our Iranian friends who indicated that it would not have been so reported without the approval of His Majesty. Naturally we were delighted. Later we were entertained by his Excellency [[Manouchehr Eghbal|Manoutchehr Eghbal]] who told us that he had discussed the grant with the Shahanshah and that the grant would be forthcoming through the [[National Iranian Oil Company]]. He confirmed this when we returned to Iran at the invitation of the Empress, which you so graciously arranged. When I asked him if there was anything further which I should do to expedite the grant he smiled and said, “No, I will take care of it right away.” I feel sure that his untimely death has contributed to the delay.
>
>We have proceeded to set up the Chair and the first occupant is a distinquished \[*sic*\] professor, Dr. [[Irving Melbo]], who served for several years as Dean of the School of Education at [[USC|the University of Southern California]] and who is very familiar with the challenges in education in Iran. He is available to spend time in Iran for the purposes outlined in our proposal.
>
>Thank you again, Ambassador Zahedi, for your advice and help in this matter. We have about one hundred capable students from distinquished \[*sic*\] Iranian families and anticipate having 125 this Fall. We cherish our good relations with them and with the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] and the [[Farah Pahlavi|Shahbanou]]. We were so favorably impressed by the leadership which the Shahanshah is giving Iran in this turbulent period and have expressed our admiration in the fire of criticism from some sectors.
>
>Please feel free to ask any further questions. Do help us resolve this matter favorably and gracefully. Remember we are eager to have you visit our Malibu campus and we trust you will allow us to honor you.

>Cordially,
