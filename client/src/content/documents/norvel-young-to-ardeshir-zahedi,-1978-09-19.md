>Dear Ardeshir:
>Words are inadequate to express our jubilation at receiving the magnificent gift from [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|His Majesty the Shahanshah]]. I have communicated the good news to our [[Board of Regents]] and they are all deeply appreciative and join with me in expressing our profound gratitude.
>
>As you know, Pepperdine University has already appointed Dr. [[Irving Melbo]] as the first occupant of the Chair in honor of [[Farah Pahlavi|Her Majesty the Shahbanou]]. He has already served for one year in this capacity and of course will continue to do so. We will continue with the plans as previously outlined to you.
>
>Please express to all involved my appreciation for the gift, and I will, of course, write to [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|His Majesty]] to thank him personally. My thoughts are with him at this time of sadness due to the earthquake in Tubas. \[*sic*\]
>
>We are pleased to have more than one hundred Iranian students on our campus this year. We are enjoying their fine influence and feel that they are having a wonderful experience. Please call on me at any time I can be of assistance in any way.
>
>I wish to again extend an invitation for you to visit our campus. We would be so pleased to honor you at that time.
>
>Cordially yours,
