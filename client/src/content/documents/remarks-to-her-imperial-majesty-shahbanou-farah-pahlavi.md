Several hundred of your fine students are attending the University, and a number of your talented citizens have participated as faculty and associates. This year, as approved by [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|His Imperial Majesty]], Pepperdine University established a permanent Chair in Higher Education in your honor. The distinquished \[*sic*\] professor, Dr. [[Irving Melbo]], former Dean of the [[USC|University of Southern California]], who teaches in this Chair, will also spend time in Iran each year as a consultant. This chair will be a permanent memorial to the friendship between Iran and Pepperdine University, and a further strengthening of relationships between Iran and the United States.
>
>Forty years ago, I first visited your country as a college student on a world study tour. I fell in love with your historic land and was deeply impressed by your people. It is a keen personal privilege to return as Chancellor of the University, to honor you for your significant role in the leadership of Iran in a time of unprecedented transition and progress.
>
>On a recent trip to our country, you were honored with an award for your humanitarian concerns. We were greatly impressed with your words of concern for the dignity and welfare of mankind and particularly for the poor, the handicapped and otherwise underprivileged of the world. We have heard many expressions of admiration from your own countrymen, of their esteem for you, and for your constant work for the underprivileged.
>
>We know of your interest and diligent efforts in Education and the Arts. You have been instrumental in increasing opportunities for women to full participation in the life of your nation.
>
>We believe that you have shown by your deeds, as well as by your words, your great love for all your people. Today we honor you especially for your enlightened leadership of the women of Iran. You have emphasized that Education is the key to the progress of women. When we look around among the nations of the world to select a woman who is aggressively using her leadership to lift the level of female education, we are struck by your admirable record.
>
>Therefore, for these many reasons, but especially for your role as a leader in the progress of women through education, we honor you today.
