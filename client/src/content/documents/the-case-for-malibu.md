“The Case for Malibu” is an essay arguing that Pepperdine should accept the Adamson family’s offer of a plot of land in Malibu. It was written in March 1968 by [[William S. Banowsky]], who would soon become executive vice president of Pepperdine University. The essay is included in a letter to Pepperdine president [[M. Norvel Young]].

If this is the five-page letter mentioned on page 80 of Banowsky’s memoir *The Malibu Miracle*, the original letter may have been written October 26, 1967.

This document may be the origin of a long history of people using the word “distinctive” to characterize Pepperdine, a trend that resulted in David Baird’s 2016 history of the university being titled “Quest for Distinction.”

>It is my judgment that the Malibu site is greatly superior to the Westlake proposition (and to all others previously considered). I will set forth basic reasons which lead me toward this conclusion.
>
>The key lies in the uniqueness and distincitiveness \[*sic*\] of the Malibu site. The only chance our kind of college will have for greatness--and perhaps even for survival--in the next quarter century must come from its _distinctiveness_. We will never be able to compete with USC in size, with UCLA in facilities, with Occidental in academic excellence, with [[El Camino College|El Camino]] in inexpensiveness to the student. Why should there even be a Pepperdine College? Many would say that Pepperdine could close its doors next fall and the work of education in Southern California would continue unchanged with such institutions as those named above easily assuming _most_ of the work being done by Pepperdine. Our response would be, "Yes, _most_ but not _all_ of the work." In this claim, our _raison d'etre_ must be established.
>
>Of course, our contention is that when the work of USC, UCLA, Occidental, El Camino, etc. has been finished, there is still _something_ being offered by Pepperdine which none of them quite matches. How does one describe that _something_? Perhaps, a composite description is needed:
>
>1. Pepperdine's bold Christian claims undergirding all academic work.
>2. Pepperdine's non-sectarian stance.
>3. Pepperdine's effort to create a truly spiritual campus atmosphere.
>4. Pepperdine's emphasis on personal attention to individual students.
>5. Pepperdine's high academic effort within a spiritual framework.
>6. Pepperdine's ability to maintain basic American ideals tempered by a dynamic willingness to change and experiment.
>7. Pepperdine's emphasis on human values in the midst of a vast and mechanized society.
>8. Pepperdine's independence from state, federal, church, or political control.
>
>In all of these and other areas Pepperdine claims its _right to be_ on the premise of distinctiveness. Pepperdine is different! Distinctive education is our only hope. And campus location is important in maintaining this distinction. You have been courageous to take your time and move with slow, deliberate steps to secure a geographic spot to fully match and dynamically expand the college's claims to distinctiveness. I now urge you to see in the proposed Malibu site the full realization of this goal.
>
>Does mere geographic location make so much difference? Perhaps not to UCLA (though Westwood is obviously able to do something which Maywood could never do) because the government can put up sufficient funds to overwhelm the matter of location. But to an operation like ours, mere location can make the difference between mediocrity or excellence, between success or failure.
>
>While the Westlake site is a splendid one, and the college is to be complimented by such an offer, it is seriously _lacking in distinctiveness_. I actually think the Calabasas site would be more _distinctive_ and more capable of preserving the uniqueness of the college across the years. On the other hand, if it were down to a decision between these two, I would have no serious objection to going for Westlake over Calabasas on the basis of more acres, more buildable land, location in the midst of such a fantastic city development, etc. But Westlake, in my judgment, would probably never be as _distinctive_ a location in the minds of Los Angeles peopleas \[*sic*\] Calabasas. I took the time to read a special magazine section and a brochure on Westlake and have seen the truly remarkable features of their master plan for the entire city with lakes, golf courses, imposing homes, etc. But Westlake City will tend to become just that, a self-contained little city without distinctive or dynamic ties with Los Angeles. The whole atmosphere could tend to make Pepperdine look like any other suburban college. It seems to me that Westlake would be the kind of place where the state of California would choose to put one of their neighborhood junior colleges. But Pepperdine must not be willing to accept classification along with such neighborhood colleges.
>
>On the other hand, there is now and always will be _only_ _one_ _Malibu_. A college built at Malibu will forever have an edge in distinctiveness on the weight of location alone! I would favor Calabasas over Westlake on the strength of distinctiveness, but would yield to Westlake because the difference could be outweighed by other advantages at Westlake. _But I would regard losing Malibu for Westlake to be a tragedy of the greatest proportions._
>I would prefer to have forty acres at Malibu over 250 acres at Westlake for the following reasons:
>
>_Distinctive Ties with Los Angeles_
>9. Malibu has always been and is now closely identified with Los Angeles.
>10. Malibu is geographically closer to Los Angeles than either of the other sites. (We actually timed it from Topanga Canyon to the Civic Center in twenty "easy" minutes.)
>11. You can actually see the complete harbor from Malibu and all the way from Zuma to Palos Verdes and even Catalina Island. There is the sensation that you are still very much in Los Angeles.
>12. The Los Angeles business community can be challenged to help financially.
>
>_Distinctive in Reputation_
>13. Malibu has a legendary past going all the way back to the Spanish explorers.
>14. Its name is known throughout the world.
>15. Its image is plus all the way.
>
>_Distinctive in Beauty and Aesthetic Quality_
>16. The beauty of the location is unsurpassed.
>17. The combination of the magnificent view of the ocean, the beach front, and the rugged mountains behind is a winner.
>18. It is close to Los Angeles, yet removed with an atmosphere of relaxation.
>
>_Distinctive in Climate_
>19. No climate in the world is really superior to it. With a high of 80 and a low of 54, an average humidity of 60 per cent, a water temperature of 70 degrees in the summer.
>20. The location will always be absolutely smog free.
>
>_Distinctive in Protection and Changelessness_
>21. While change is inevitable everywhere, Malibu has unusual protection against normal urban and suburban deterioration.
>22. The ocean will never change, it is today just as it was at creation.
>23. The severely rugged mountains behind will also change very little, and are today absolutely unspoiled.
>24. With the buffer provided by the ocean and the mountains, and the freeway to come in front of the campus, we will be locating the college at a site which will maintain its uniqueness for hundreds of years.
>
>_Distinctive Appeal to Students_
>25. The very name "Malibu" has a magic ring all over the nation to young people. It will not sound like an exclusive resort area but a place "where the action is."
>26. We can be very effective in recruiting day students from Los Angeles.
>27. Most importantly, we need desperately to increase the percentage of our boarding students to as much as 2 to 1. Malibu will provide this opportunity.
>28. The tuition level we must change will be entirely consistent with such a location and academic atmosphere.
>
>_Distinctive Appeal to Faculty_
>29. The task of recruiting and maintaining the kind of faculty we need will be a cinch with this location.
>
>_Distinctive in its Appeal to Donors_
>30. People capable of making the unusually large gifts which we need are looking for the unusual, the extraordinary, the different. All of the assets of the Malibu location can be drawn into an impelling case for large contributions.
>31. Los Angeles, Westwood, Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Hollywood, Pacific Palisades--these impressive cities will be our near neighbors.
>
>_Distinctive as an Educational Site_
>32. We will be closer to UCLA from Malibu than Pepperdine now is.
>33. We can draw the discriminating kind of student who lives in Westwood, Santa Monica, Pacific Palisades, Hollywood, Beverly Hills, etc., now attending UCLA.
>34. Some recent California state colleges have been located on or very near the ocean.
>
>Malibu has that intangible something which distinguishes it from more ordinary sites as Westlake.
>
>May I urge you to be very decisive in pushing for Malibu.
>
>Malibu has the capacity to excite. It excites me greatly.
