This is a letter from Pepperdine alumnus [[Trent Devenney]] to [[Dan McMichael]], an associate of Pepperdine donor [[Richard Scaife]]. In the letter, Devenney explains what has come to be known as the [[Trent Devenney affair]].

>April 20, 1973
>
>Mr. Dan McMichael
>Scaife Family Charitable Trust
>Oliver Building
>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15322
>
>Dear Mr. McMichael:
>
>I want to thank you for giving me so much of your time on the telephone last Tuesday. I would have normally written to you in order to give you an explaination \[*sic*\] of my purposes prior to such an extended discussion, but it was impossible. I had just come from a 5 hour meeting with [[George Benson|George S. Benson]], and he told me that I should not waste any time trying to reach you. Therefore, I called you immediately.
>
>It  is important for you to understand that I came to you primarily because I know that your continued confidence in Pepperdine University is essential if that institution is ultimately destined to serve a constructive purpose in our community. I can say, without equivocation, that Pepperdine will not survive the coming months without your continued support.
>
>As you know I am an alumnus of Pepperdine University, having graduated in 1964. You must understand, however, that I represent diverse interests in my current efforts to strengthen the University.
>
>The first person to retain my services in this work was [[Gordon Del Faro|a donor]] who is a businessman with deep involvements in California politics. He feels (correctly) that [[William S. Banowsky|William Banowsky]] is an opportunist and that he is a phoney \[*sic*\] conservative; therefore, his interest is to see that Dr. Banowsky’s political aspirations do not conflict with the aspirations of men whose sincerity is proven by their achievements.
>
>The next man to retain my services in this work is [[Archie Luper|a member of the University Board]]. His only interest is to see that constructive educational purposes are fulfilled within the structure of the University. He has long been aware that the institution is monolythically \[*sic*\] liberal internally.
>
>Finally, I represent [[Ira Rice|certain prominent members]] of the Church of Christ who feel that the religious orientation of the University is “un-orthodox”.
>
>I do not technically represent [[Helen Pepperdine|Mrs. Pepperdine]] as her legal counsel in this matter. She has no attorney. It is true, however, that I have been advising her and that she has done what I have asked in certain strategic matters.
>
>You should understnad \[*sic*\] that Mrs. Pepperdine is a very worried and a very confused woman at the present time. She feels that the University is in a situation where it will collapse, and will be lost to her, unless the proper actions are taken. Unfortunately, she is being given conflicting advice.
>
>To make matters worse, the Administration moved a woman into Mrs. Pepperdine’s home just on the heels of my advising her to seek the assistance of George S. Benson. This requires some explaination \[*sic*\].
>
>Mrs. Pepperdine turned her entire estate over to Pepperdine University at some time within the past 3 years. She receives an annuity in return. No longer having any money to give to the University, the Administration lost interest in her and failed to show her any attention. They even avoided giving her invitations to certain events on the grounds that there just weren’t enough seats to supply the demand. This caused Mrs. Pepperdine to be free from the day-to-day influence of the Administration and she began to look around for herself. She didn’t like what she was seeing and, over a period of the past year, she called special meetings of the [[Board of Regents|Board of Trustees]] to try to correct the problems. She failed.
>
>I came into the picture and advised her to go to Dr. Benson and, immediately, the Administration has become “attentive”. I think they fear George Benson more than they fear the Devil. Anyway, the Administration advised Mrs. Pepperdine to allow [[Charles Runnels|Charlie Runnels]]’ secretary move into her home so that she wouldn’t be “lonely” and so that she would have a chauffeur when she needed to go out. The result has been that she stays confused most of the time.
>
>Prior to this woman moving into her home, Mrs. Pepperdine was beginning to stear \[*sic*\] a steady, direct course toward solving the problems at Pepperdine. Now she will have a conference with me, and will come to agree on the situation and its solution, and then she goes home and gets confused.
>
>I simply don’t have the heart to try to dispell \[*sic*\] her confidence in the woman who has moved into her home. This is for two reasons: first, this woman is an old friend and, second, Mrs. Pepperdine is very lonely and she needs to think that this woman’s interest is genuine. There’s a third reason too. I don’t have someone to replace this woman with (i.e. I can’t point to someone and say, “Mrs. Pepperdine, there is a real friend for you.).
>
>I want you to understand that this is an enormously sad situation. Mrs. Pepperdine has been “taken” by family friends, by young men that she and Mr. Pepperdine put through school and even by Elders in her own church. It’s simply outrageous and, at her age, I don’t really know how she has the courage to face up to the facts that she has already faced.
>
>I am attempting to set up a meeting between Mrs. Pepperdine and [[Jerene Appleby Harnish|Jerene Harnish]] because Mrs. Harnish is a woman who knows how to bring order out of chaos. Mrs. Harnish is fully aware of the extent of the problems at Pepperdine and has indicated a desire to see them corrected. She is an enormously strong woman and she could give Mrs. Pepperdine the courage and the certainty that she needs.
>
>I was hoping that I could look to your interests to support Mrs. Pepperdine at this troublesome stage.
>
>I must raise another important point in this letter, and I don’t think I covered it sufficiently in our brief conversation. It is the political implication of the problems at Pepperdine.
>
>The [[Gordon Del Faro|businessman]] who first retained my services has a strong desire to see that Dr. Banowsky will not be competing with sound conservative politicians in the future. This is really his only interest in my work; although, I am certain that he would like for conservatives to have control over Pepperdine University.
>
>I am being compelled by this man to take my information to the Office of the Attorney General and to request that the Trust Department begin an [[Attorney General investigation|investigation]] of Pepperdine University. I must make an appointment with the [[Evelle Younger|Attorney General]] on Monday, April 23, 1973.
>
>I have advised against this move continuously and my advice has been followed until today. The reason for the change of attitude in this businessman is that George Putnam announced, last night on his evening news cast, that William Banowsky would announce his candidacy for the U.S. Senate against [[Alan Cranston|Allen Cranston]]. This has precipitated a demand that I take some immediate action to see that strong forces demand an accounting from the Board of Trustees and that this be done thoroughly. I have a certain amount of evidence that there are “irregularities”.
>
>I am certain that the situation at Pepperdine is far worse than we can really imagine. Mrs. Pepperdine has admitted that it is far worse than I, personally, am aware, but she will not elaborate.
>
>This campaign will give Dr. Banowsky an opportunity to leave Pepperdine before in \[*sic*\] all falls down on him (thereby ruining him positively) and he will have the “advantage” of being able to label his critics as “politically motivated”. It also shows, however, how really thoughtless of Pepperdine University he really is. His move into politics will put the University into the situation like a political battlefield. Every “transgression” will be resurrected to use against him.
>
>Bill saw the handwriting on the wall in January when he tried to get the job at [[San Francisco State]], but he was stopped. Someone probably got to [[Glenn S. Dumke|Dumpke]] and warned him. But this campaign may be his only means of escape and he has apparently chosen it. Incidentally, he has done this in spite of the fact that he has consistently people that his only interest was in Pepperdine.
>
>As I indicated, I am concerned that an investigation by the Attorney General will turn the campus into a political battlefield. If it’s true that the situation is extremely bad financially, then the institution could have a tarnished image for years to come. This could cause it to be lost for the purposes of conservative education.
>
>If you could find any possible legal means, your interests should step into this situation immediately. Otherwise, all of our investments in the University could be lost. I think that if we try to clean it up internally we could insure public confidence in the institution.
>
>I have notified Mrs. Pepperdine that I would like to address the next meeting of the Board of Trustees, and she indicated that they may have to call a special meeting of the Board for this purpose. They don’t have many regular meetings! I think that my appearance will be within 1 month.
>
>Incidentally, I have sent you 2 reports on Pepperdine University. One was done by [[Doyle Swain]] and the other by myself. They are both in rough draft form and will be rewritten prior to the Board meeting.
>
>I will send you a report of exhibits which I have gathered, but I will have to prepare an explaination \[*sic*\] for them. I had intended to show them to you personally and to explain them myself. This report will contain more financial information than the 2 reports already sent.
