>Dear Mrs. Young:
>
>This letter will serve to confirm our recent phone conversation.
>
>I received a telephone call on Monday, April 23, 1973, at approximately 5:07 pm. I was informed that Dr. Young’s office was calling to notify me that he was unable to call himself but that he wanted me to be informed, by 5 pm, that he had considered my request, made through [[Helen Pepperdine|Mrs. George Pepperdine]], that I be allowed to appear before the [[Board of Trustees]] of Pepperdine University.
>
>I was further informed that Dr. Young requests that I submit to him, in writing, any statements or issues which I wish to discuss with the Board of Trustees and that Dr. Young would determine, on the basis of the information submitted to him, whether the material had merit or was significant enough to be submitted to the Board of Trustees.
>
>At the conclusion of this conversation, I stated that I would take this determination under consideration. I also requested that the caller identify herself, and I was told that the caller was Mrs. Young, Mrs. [[Helen Mattox Young|Helen Young]].
>
>We are all aware of the serious breach of confidence between Pepperdine University and the conservative community and we are also aware of the seriousness of the financial and academic problems facing the University. In due course I will make [[Trent Devenney to Norvel Young, 1973-04-30|a more formal request]] to appear before the Board of Trustees, and I shall expect my request to be given very serious consideration.
