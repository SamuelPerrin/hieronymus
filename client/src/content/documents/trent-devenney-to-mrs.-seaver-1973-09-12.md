>Dear Mrs. Seaver,
>
>I was very happy to see you at the Pro-America luncheon on Wednesday; although, I didn’t have an opportunity to speak with you. I came late and left early because of a trial in which I was engaged.
>
>[[Dick Vetterli]] was a professor of mine at Pepperdine, and I know that there has never been a better man on the faculty of the University than himself. He was enormously popular with students and they were sorry to see him leave Pepperdine.
>
>You and I had an opportunity to talk together several months ago when we met at the Wilshire Country Club, and we spoke of the need for quality, conservative faculty members to be located at Pepperdine. I know that we will ultimately achieve that objective.
>
>I don’t think that there has ever been a more generous and, at the same time, a more right-thinking donor to any college or university in our country. Your purposes and your objectives are not only clear and definite, but they are timely. You have made your gifts during a period in our history when our country needs such gifts and also at a time when our people are beginning to recognize that need.
>
>Your objectives and your purposes will ultimately be achieved in Pepperdine and your investments will prove to be the wisest that have been made in our generation. Many of us will continue to work to see that gifts, such as your own, are not subverted by people who may have deceptive designs. Pepperdine University will, one day soon, become a strong light in the darkness of our country.
>
>With kindest regards, I am
>Sincerely yours,
