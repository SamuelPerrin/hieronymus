>Dear Dr. Young:
>
>I am writing to you as an alumnus of Pepperdine to request that you call a special meeting of the Board of Trustees of Pepperdine University. Certain legal action is about to be taken against the University and I fell, as a friend of the University, that I am obligated to formally notify the Board.
>
>I don’t feel that I have to tell you how serious the situation is at Pepperdine. There isn’t even a need, any longer, to discuss the philosophical or the religious atmosphere of the University. All of the attention is now focused on the conflicts of interest between the University and the Board of Trustees and the possible conflicts of interest between certain members of the University Board and Pepperdine University. The circumstances that exist, particularly on the Board of Trustees, are simply an outrage.
>
>Please call a special meeting of the Board so that I may formally notify them of the actions that are being taken, by whom the actions are being taken, and what the nature of the actions will be. The Board of Trustees must also be alerted to the fact that certain members may become liable in civil damages and, if the situation is as bad as I have been led to believe, there will be criminal liability in certain areas.
>
>As an attorney, I have been compelled to recommend that the businessmen that I represent undertake, beginning April 28, 1973, to hire plain clothed, armed security guards to maintain a 24 hour surveillance of the Los Angeles Campus. [[Helen Pepperdine|Mrs. Pepperdine]] has informed me that there has been an incident of arson in one of the main buildings on that campus.
>
>We do not know how this originated or what records of the University might have been destroyed. The point is, however, that any loss of financial or business records will be investigated and any attempted arson of University property will be thwarted by a 24 hour surveillance.
>
>A special meeting of the Board of Trustees should be held no later than 10 days from the date of this letter. This will give you ample time to notify the Board that I wish to address them personally and as a friend of the University. I have absolutely no ability to withhold the actions which are, at this date, pending. I have consistently acted as a restraining influence but, unfortunately, I have received documentation this week concerning the University finances which is so shocking that no amount of persuading will prevent businessmen from seeking a legal redress of their legitimate grievances.
>
>I will expect the Board of Trustees to authorize, without hesitation, the use of armed, plain clothed security guards around the Los Angeles Campus. I will also expect the Board of Trustees to establish a system of checks and authorizations for the use of any financial and business records coming in or going out of the files, vaults or safe deposit boxes of Pepperdine University.
>
>It will also be necessary that the Board of Trustees approve the use of an official court reporter at this, and any future, meeting of the Board.
>
>I recommend that you notify all members of the Board in writing or by telegram of this special meeting, and I am sending each member a copy of this letter by appropriate post.
>Sincerely yours,
>\[unsigned\]
