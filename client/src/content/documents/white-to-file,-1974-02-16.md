This is a memo to file, written by Pepperdine executive vice president [[Howard A. White]], dated February 16, 1974. In the memo, White speculates about why president [[William S. Banowsky]] rejected an offer to be president of Lubbock Christian College.

Typos in the original are reproduced with \[*sic*\], but some typos (like spacing errors) have been silently corrected.

>February 16, 1974
>
>Yesterday after the University Coordinating Council meeting, [[William S. Banowsky|Bill]] talked to [[Jerry Hudson]] and me for about two hours in my office. He said he had had a religious experience that made him wish to devote the rest of his life to doing the work of God and that he was finished with politics.
>
>There was nothing new in his statement that he was quitting politics--he has said that so many times that it is a broken record. The religious experience was a new development. As a result of it, he said he wishes to take Pepperdine away from the narrow, sectarian approach of the Churches of Christ and make the school somewhat like [[Westmont]] or [[Wheaton]], with an interdenominational flavor. Since this will not get [[M. Norvel Young|Dr. Young]]'s approval, he said he (Bill) would accept the offer to become president of [[Lubbock Christian University|Lubbock Christian College]].
>
>Bill said Lubbock is rinky-dink, small, and would pay only $22,500 in salary, whereas he made $98,000 last year at Pepperdine, counting speaking engagements. Nevertheless, he said Lubbock has a chance to "make it" for the future, whereas Pepperdine cannot unless it cuts loose from the Churches of Christ.
>
>I asked Bill if he were willing to take steps that would cause all of us who stay at Pepperdine to be regarded as Benedict Arnolds in the church, and he said he is. I told him I am unwilling to do that, which in effect would be to say to the Churches of Christ that we hold them in contempt and wish to leave them. I told him that this is our heritage, that the church is our mother, and I am unwilling to call her a whore and turn my back on her. (Probably a good many of my associates at Pepperdine would call me narrowly sectarian, for I believe strongly in the [[Restoration Movement|Restoration]] plea. While the Churches of Christ, composed of human beings, are guilty of many faults and of a sectarian spirit, I still believe in the ideal that we profess to follow the Scriptures. If we cannot do that, or should not do that, then to me religion becomes a humanistic enterprise that holds no great interest).
>
>Bill said that [[M. Norvel Young|Norvel]] would really like to have an interdenominational school, but just does not have the nerve. I think he is wrong about Norvel, whose views may be much more liberal than mine, but who in my opinion sincerely wishes to hold on to the church. I feel strongly that [[Helen Mattox Young|Helen]] (Mrs. Young) does.
>
>Tuesday, February 19, is the day Bill says he must give Lubbock an answer. Of course he can move the deadline around any way he wishes. That little school is short of cash and of leadership, and he can probably dictate anything to them that he wishes, so far as timing is concerned.
>
>The biggest problem in his resigning now or later would be the probability of losing the interest and money of [[Blanche Seaver|Mrs. Frank R. Seaver]], who has given Pepperdine so much because of Bill. She has agreed to make her trust to Pepperdine irrevocable as of October of this year, but for tax reasons involving her relative, [[Richard Seaver]], she cannot do it now without his risking the loss of 5 of \[*sic*\] millions in inheritance taxes.
>
>In our conversation, Bill said if he stays at Pepperdine, "Then next Wednesday morning I will be president of Pepperdine for the first time." He means he and not Norvel would really have control. I am still convinced that this whole series of events is an effort on Bill's part to seize power, and he now says he has a divine mandate to do so. To talk of chaning \[*sic*\] Pepperdine so as to repudiate the church or, failing that, to move to Lubbock Christian, reveals to me a complete lack of basic conviction about either one.
>
>I talked to Norvel on the phone an hour this morning. I think he is standing firm.
