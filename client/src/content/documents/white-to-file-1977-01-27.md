This is a memo to file, written by Pepperdine executive vice president [[Howard A. White]], dated January 27, 1977. In the memo, White recounts a plan by [[William S. Banowsky|Bill Banowsky]] and [[M. Norvel Young|Norvel Young]] to alter the membership of the university’s governing Board of Regents.

>January 27, 1977

>Several days ago [[M. Norvel Young|Norvel Young]] told me that [[William S. Banowsky|Bill]] is planning to enlarge the [[Board of Regents]] again with more non-church members. The rationale would probably be that we need more men with money to bolster that organization. To date we have not seen that the ones we have already added are giving any more money than formerly, although of course they may give more later.
>
>Bill has had a particularly difficult time with the [[Hydril Co.|Hydril]] stock, in which case Pepperdine’s holdings would have brought a large sum, variously estimated in reports I have heard to be about $70 million. Bill even has had [[Leonard Straus]], of Thrifty Drug Stores, to work with Lehman Brothers in New York toward boying \[*sic*\] Pepperdine’s interest in Hydril, but that could lead to [[Richard Seaver|Richard]]’s losing control, which of course he does not wish to do. He has been perturbed enough by Pepperdine’s efforts to sell the stock that his year-end gift in 1976 was only $150,000. Bill attributed this amount that was given instead of the $500,000 or so that usually comes in to Richard’s displeasure about the stock. Bill has, in my opinion, not only been motivated by the wish to get the money, but also by his wish to cultivate Leonard Straus in the hope of getting the Jewish vote if Bill decides later to run for some public office.
>
>So we hold stock that with other stock that we will inherit from [[Blanche Seaver|Mrs. Seaver]] that could ultimately be worth $130,000,000. Until we can get some or all of that money, cash will be tight, but the future of the school is in the long run fairly well assured.
>
>This would be a great opportunity for Bill to preside over a Christian school that would have more assets than any of our schools have ever had, to make it truly Christian but independent and without provincialism or sectarianism. In giving what she has donated, Mrs. Seaver has well understood the [[Pepperdine and the Churches of Christ|church relationship]], although her knowledge of the churches of Christ may be limited. She has long attended [[Inglewood Church of Christ|Inglewood church]] with [[Charles Runnels]], and by no stretch of the imagination could it be fairly stated that Bill’s determination to bring about the ultimate separation or \[*sic*\] the institution from its church relationship is based on the desires of Mrs. Seaver or any other large donor. Their money has been given to Pepperdine __with__ its Christian commitment and not with the promise that the commitment would be forsaken. It is only fair to state that Mrs. Seaver has given her money largely out of her admiration for Bill himself. He deserves full credit for all he has raised, but Norvel has also raised a very large part of what Pepperdine has. (The morality of courting Mrs. Seaver and flattering her to get her money is another question. Bill would not give her the time of day without her money as a consideration, just as he pays virtually no attention to Mrs. Pepperdine. Another aspect of the morality of all this is seen in a recent meeting of the Executive Committee of the Board of Regents that I attended. In connection with financing the construction of the [[Caruso School of Law|Law School]], some of the regents were discussing the irrevocable trust of Mr. [[Odell McConnell]], who has pledged about 3 or 4 million dollars. In coarse jokes they speculated on the time of his demise so that we could get the money, and it is noteworthy that they did not even get his surname right--they called him “O’Donnell.”)

>[[Jerry Hudson]] was in town last week. We had dinner Thursday night, and I took him to the airport Sunday. He said Bill offered him the post of provost at Pepperdine, but not the presidency. Jerry is not interested in being provost. He said Bill told him he planned to change the rule that the chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board must be a member of the church or that a majority of the members of that committee must be members. Jerry also reported that when he asked Bill who would choose the next president if Bill were to die in a plane crash and that Bill said it would be people such as [[John Vaughn]] and [[Leonard Straus]].
>
>Time was when I fervently hoped that Jerry Hudson would return as president, and for the sake of my personal relations with him, I would rather have him than anybody I can think of who has any chance at getting the job, but I must sadly conclude that unless he has a change of heart, he would do no more for our Christian commitment than Bill is doing, and it may be that we are now in such a state of spiritual deterioration that nobody could do very much to reverse it.
>
>Yesterday afternoon I talked with Norvel about 2 hours at the [[Adamson House|Beach House]]. He asked me to talk with him about a proposal to get Bill to give about $10 million in assets to form a separate corporation of our church constituency to control an institute or other organization separate from [[Seaver College]]. This body would offer religion courses, choose its own faculty, and run its own affairs with credit being given by Seaver College, or in case of advanced degrees, maybe in its own right.
>
>Norvel prefaced all this by saying that Bill intended to move soon to name additional non-church member regents (especially if Mrs. Seaver does not recover from the fall that has hospitalized her). Norvel said that Bill is considering installing dancing by next September. By itself this in my opinion is not one of our most crucial issues, but in the context of other moves we are making, this will be regarded as another signal that Pepperdine disdains its affilation \[*sic*\] with church of Christ. Norvel agrees that we are now moving fairly fast in the direction of severing church ties.
>
>I told him I would cooperate in any move that would be a genuine and valid approach to having the Bible taught by faithful teachers, but that I did not wish to be part of a charade or camouflage that would keep the opposition quiet while Bill proceeds with his plans that would ultimately negate any attempt to have the Bible taught. I told Norvel I had the following reservations:
>1. Bill would not agreed \[*sic*\] to dedicate the financial resources
>2. Even if he did, the pressure from the rest of Seaver College would eventually lead to denying credit to courses that were conservatively oriented.
>
>Therefore I would rather have no institute or religion center than to have one that pushes the views of such as [[Royce Clark]].
>
>Bill continues to be an enigma. He sends his children to a Baptist school, which indicates he wants to have the advantages of rather conservative religious training. But with no real pushing from the regents, he can hardly wait to end Pepperdine’s connect \[*sic*\] with the church. Richard Seaver is ashamed of our “fundamentalism” etc., and I think Bill is too. While he does not use the word on himself, I think Bill’s proper position is that of an agnostic. He told me recently that he regards my metaphysics as rather odd.
>
>While I shall always admire Bill’s ability and always be grateful for the many ways he has shown confidence in me and given me a challenging work to do, I also resent the fact that he has exploited me to help keep the peace while he goes forward with his plans. My resignation would not have stopped him, but could have made it more difficult for him to proceed. I consider it most immoral to break the ties with the church and go contrary to the wishes of our founder, no matter how much money has been piled on top of the original donation of Mr. Pepperdine.
