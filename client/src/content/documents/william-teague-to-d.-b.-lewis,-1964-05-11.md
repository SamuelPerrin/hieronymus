This is a letter from [[William J. Teague]] to [[Dallas B. Lewis]], dated May 11, 1964. In the letter, Teague explains to Lewis what the procedure would be for Pepperdine to grant an honorary doctorate to [[Dan Smoot]], indicating that Lewis had sought to honor Smoot years before the [[Smoot affair]].

The “groundbreaking and commencement” mentioned by Teague was almost certainly the April 19, 1964 groundbreaking ceremony for a Science Center that was never actually built on Pepperdine’s Los Angeles campus. The ceremony took place alongside the college’s spring commencement exercises.

>Dear D.B.:
>
>Having just returned from an extended trip to the East coast, it is my pleasure to respond to your letter of May 5. [[M. Norvel Young|Dr. Young]] and I have discussed the matter of the doctor’s degree for [[Dan Smoot|Mr. Smoot]]. His work is well known to us although we have not had the pleasure of meeting him in person. We hope to make contact with him on one of our future trips to his home city in an effort to lay the groundwork for presenting his name and qualifications to the three groups which must act upon it before the presentation of the degree could be finalized.
>
>As a matter of information, the procedure that must be followed is:
>1. Recommendation by President Young to the Administrative Committee of the College. This Committee is composed of the key administrators plus faculty representatives.
>2. Approval and recommendation of the Administrative Committee to the Departmental Council. The Departmental Council is made up of all department heads plus the Dean and the President, and one or two other senior members of the teaching faculty.
>3. Upon approval by the Departmental Council, the candidate is considered by the [[Board of Trustees]] and a decision is made.
>4. Presentation of the proposal to candidate for his acceptance or rejection.
>
>If Mr. Smoot is to be on the West Coast any time in the near future when Dr. Young could meet him, it would probably serve a very useful purpose since in all cases of this kind, the Committee almost invariably asks for Dr. Young’s personal evaluation of the candidate.
>
>It was good to see you at the groundbreaking and commencement. We hope it was a pleasant experience for you and [[Yolanda Lewis|Mrs. Lewis]].
>
>Cordially yours,
>\[unsigned\]
