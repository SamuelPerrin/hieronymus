The shah debacle was a series of events in the late 1970s involving Pepperdine University and the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|shah of Iran]]. In 1977, Pepperdine awarded honorary degrees to the shah and [[Farah Pahlavi|his wife]] and proposed an endowed chair in honor of the empress. The shah agreed to donate one million dollars to establish the chair, which was duly created and filled, but Pepperdine didn’t receive the money until nearly eighteen months later, just before the shah was exiled.
