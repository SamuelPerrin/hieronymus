The Trent Devenney affair was a series of events at Pepperdine University in the mid-1970s, initiated by disgruntled alumnus Trent Devenney, who sought to remake the university as a solidly conservative institution. What began as a letter-writing campaign evolved into a [[Attorney General investigation|state attorney general investigation]] concerning the university’s executive compensation. No charges were filed, but practices were changed.
