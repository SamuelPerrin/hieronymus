New Windsor, located in New York, served as the location of [[George Washington]]'s headquarters and Continental Army winter encampment during 1780-1781.

The Continental Army maintained a supply depot and headquarters at New Windsor during the critical periods of the [[American Revolution]]. It was from here that [[Alexander Hamilton]] corresponded with Washington about the dire supply situation facing the troops during the harsh winter.

The town's strategic position along the Hudson River made it an important location for military communications and operations throughout the war, particularly for controlling the Hudson Highlands and maintaining connections with West Point.
