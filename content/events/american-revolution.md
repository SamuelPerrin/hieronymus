The American Revolution (1775-1783), also known as the American Revolutionary War or the American War of Independence, was a conflict between Great Britain and its thirteen colonies in North America, which had declared themselves as independent states, forming the United States of America.

The war began as a result of increasing colonial opposition to British attempts to impose greater control and taxation in the colonies. The first military engagements were the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. The colonies formally declared their independence with the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776.

Key figures in the American Revolution included [[George Washington]], who commanded the Continental Army; [[Alexander Hamilton]], who served as Washington's aide-de-camp; [[Thomas Jefferson]], who drafted the Declaration of Independence; and Benjamin Franklin, who secured French alliance and financial support.

The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on September 3, 1783, which recognized the sovereignty of the United States and ended British rule over the territories that became the first 13 states of the new nation.
